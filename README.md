# 🚀 Predicting NYC Apartment Sales Prices: A Machine Learning Pipeline Experiment 🏙️
Hello, World:), and welcome to my project where I dive deep into predicting the sales prices of NYC apartments using a Machine Learning pipeline! This experiment covers the entire process—from cleaning and preprocessing the data to training a Random Forest model and analyzing its performance using Shapley values. It's a fun and informative journey to building a predictive model that can make sense of New York's real estate market.

🧐 Project Overview
This project is all about predicting the "SALE PRICE" of NYC apartments using various features like:

Location 📍
Property size 🏠
Neighborhood 🌆
The project follows these steps:

Problem Definition: What are we trying to predict?
Data Exploration: Let's get to know our dataset!
Feature Engineering: Cleaning up and creating useful features.
Model Design: Building the model and making predictions.
Model Evaluation: How well did our model perform?
Insights & Interpretation: Understanding which features are most important.
